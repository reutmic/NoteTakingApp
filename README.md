# NoteTakingApp
A Simple Collaborative Note-Taking App that allows multiple users to create, edit, delete, and revert to old versions of notes in real-time. This project will help users to collaborate effectively by providing a platform where notes can be updated live, ensuring all users have access to the most recent version.
