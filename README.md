<h1>Note Taking App Project</h1>
<p>This is a simple collaborative note-taking app that allows multiple users to create, edit, delete, and revert to old versions of notes in real-time. 
  This project will help users to collaborate effectively by providing a platform where notes can be updated live, 
  ensuring all users have access to the most recent version.</p>
  <p>
    In this project I used Firebase Firestore for real-time database, and Firebase Authentication for user management and login/registration functionality.
